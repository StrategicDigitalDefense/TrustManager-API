# Contributing to TrustManager-API

Firstly, thank you for being part of the TrustManager-API community. It's gratifying to know how many organizations find value in this project. 

## We Want Your Help
We know you have good ideas, and we would love your help. To see what work is needed, please see [the TODO list](TODO.md). 

## How To Report A Security-Sensitive Issue or Finding
You found a bug or weakness that a badguy could exploit? You see where we don't protect our application and our information? Let us know. 

For security-sensitive findings, please *DO* *NOT* use Git Hub [issues](https://github.com/StrategicDigitalDefense/TrustManager-API/issues) tool, as that may give badguys the information to attack when previously they hadn't discovered the weakness you did. 

Instead, please email [David](mailto:david@StrategicDigitalDefense.com) with the details. This will ensure we can coordinate disclosure with fixing the issue, and it ensures we can give you the credit for finding this. 

## How To Report All Other Issues or Findings
Please use the Git Hub [issues](https://github.com/StrategicDigitalDefense/TrustManager-API/issues) tool to add an issue describing the bug, idea, or finding. We'll review these, and if it fits with the project, we'll either deliver it or add it to [the TODO list](TODO.md). 

## How To Help With Code
Know how to do things better? Want to deliver a feature from [the TODO list](TODO.md)? We would love your contribution, and would love to give you the credit for it. 

Code contributions can be made one of two ways:
1. Make your additions in a named branch off "main" and send a merge-request.
